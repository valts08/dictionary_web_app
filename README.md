## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for words using the input field
- See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word
- See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
- Play the audio file for a word when it's available
- Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts
- Switch between light and dark themes
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- Tailwind
- Responsive design
- Redux Toolkit
- Motion
- MUI Component library
- Tanstack query

### What I learned/did

- How to interact with an SVGs properties
- Typescript got a little more intuitive for me
- How to setup Tanstack query, and how to use it for the needs of this project
- First time that I used a component library and an animation library

### Continued development

- In future projects I'd like to focus more on full-stack development and get into backend development as well. I plan on learning that by using a future project from Frontend Mentor, where I can add more features to a project after beind done with the frontend of the project
